This means checking whether a business partner is located in an embargoed country and whether the type of goods require a license if shipped to the destination country. Also the planned end-use by the customer - if known - can be fed into Export Controls and can result in a license requirement for your shipment.

Play it safe – with export controls done right!

Compliance Screening is about checking addresses against restricted party lists to comply with national and international law. Examples of addresses to check are:
- Prospective customers
- Business partners (buyer and consignee of a sales order, supplier of goods)
- Employees

To avoid any misunderstandings, it’s important to clarify that the transaction referred to as an “address” or an “address screening” in the documentation is primarily a name check. This name check also takes the address (e.g. street, city, postal code, country) into account to narrow down the screening results. It is not possible to screen data based on an address alone without a name.

The name check is possible for names of single business partners based on your master data records or for transactional objects (e.g. orders, deliveries, shipments, purchase orders) that includes several names of used business partners.

The Compliance Screening API allows you to screen addresses from any ERP or other host systems using REST or SOAP webservices.
